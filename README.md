## Hi. I'm Eric. 

Welcome to UX Engineering! I'm glad you're here. 

This is a rough, in-progress guide to working with me. It's a contract for what you can expect from me, like 1:1s, communication styles, when I'm around, that sort of thing. 

A robot claims this should take under 4 minutes to read! If you think I missed something, wrote too much, or got it all wrong, please let me know. Contributions are welcome. :D


## My role

I'm (mostly) here to make your job easier. That means different things to different people. Here's some of what it means to me:

- I will help you protect your time and pick the right workload;
- I guide our team through triage, planning, and coordination with other engineering teams;
- I can help guide your career and find ways for you to grow as a developer;

I also try to keep the team's impact on Redfin positive and obvious to the rest of the organization. We exist to connect design and engineering, and to make engineers' lives easier. If you think we could be doing better — at our work, or at sharing our work — let's talk.


## Feedback

Everybody says this, so here goes: I want your feedback. It doesn't matter if it is positive or negative, I'd prefer to hear something blunt so that I can try to improve.

I'll try to provide the same honest, constructive feedback[^See: [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/about-radical-candor/), or whatever justification you like best] to you. If you've got preferences about how and when you receive feedback, please let me know so that I can do the right thing.


## 1:1s and general calendar stuff

Every week, I’ll put 30 minutes on your calendar each week for 1:1s. If you want more time, edit the event or let me know on Slack. If weekly 1:1s feel too heavy, we can cut back. I'll add a Google Doc to the invite for both of us to add discussion topics and track previous topics and tasks. If you'd prefer some other method, again, let me know!

All my calendar invites (including 1:1s) allow invitees to edit them by default. Feel free to reschedule 1:1s, add reading material to team events, whatever.  

I keep Monday afternoons and Thursday mornings blocked off ("Unavailable"). If you're on my team, this time is yours as well — Slack me and let me know what time you'd like. I can _almost_ always make it work.


### Career growth

I reserve one per month to talk about how you feel about your role. This supplements the 6-month "check-in conversations" that Redfin uses instead of annual reviews. You can have 'em less often if you want — once a quarter might make sense for Senior+ Engineers — but this is my default. These career 1:1s help you and I plan your next promotion or make you more comfortable in your current role.


## Work/life balance

I try to keep a pretty regular schedule: I get into the office between 08:00 and 09:00, and I'm gone by 17:30 to 18:00. I don't  expect anybody on the team to be on Slack outside their normal hours.

Keeping a good work/life balance is important to me, and I hope it's important to you. Everybody at Redfin wants you to stick around. When things are busy, or a project has lit a fire under, me you might find me working late or over the weekend. I take care to make sure that is the exception and not the rule.


## Warnings

- I occasionally say I'll do something, and if I don't write it down immediately, it... well, it doesn't get done. It's a slowly-improving but very real personal failure.
- I'm bad at email. Most of what I get can wait, so I wind up checking email between a couple and zero times a day. If you need to speak with me, use Slack first.
- I sometimes talk too much. It's not ideal. Tell me to stop, and I will!
- I'm a pilot. I occasionally nerd out about airplanes. How do you know there's a pilot at your party? They'll tell you. Sorry in advance.
